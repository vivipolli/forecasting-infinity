# Forecasting Platform

## Turning Predictions into Smart Decisions

In today's fast-paced world, accurate predictions can be the difference between success and failure. Our platform revolutionizes how we make and validate predictions by bringing together experts from diverse fields to create a more reliable and actionable forecasting ecosystem.

### Our Vision

We believe that the wisdom of crowds, when properly harnessed, can lead to more accurate and reliable predictions. By connecting verified experts with real-world forecasting challenges, we're creating a new standard for decision-making based on collective intelligence.

### How We're Different

Unlike traditional prediction platforms, we focus on quality over quantity. Each prediction is carefully validated by multiple experts in the field, creating a transparent and trustworthy system. The more experts validate a prediction, the higher its visibility and reliability score becomes.

Our expert verification process is powered by advanced AI technology that analyzes candidates' digital footprint across multiple platforms. By scraping and analyzing professional profiles, publications, and online reputation, we ensure that only truly qualified professionals can contribute to the platform. This creates a virtuous cycle where better predictions attract more experts, leading to even better predictions.

### Real-World Impact

From financial markets to public policy, our platform is transforming how organizations make decisions. By providing access to validated predictions from domain experts, we're helping businesses and institutions make more informed choices in an increasingly complex world.

### Behind the Scenes

We've built our platform with modern web technologies to ensure a smooth and reliable experience:

- ‚ö°Ô∏è [React 18](https://beta.reactjs.org/)
- ü¶æ TypeScript, of course
- üé® [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - next generation utility-first CSS
- üëë [Atomic Design organization](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
- üóÇ [Relative imports](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/88#issuecomment-762415200)
- üòÉ [Hero icons](https://heroicons.com/)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy on Netlify, zero-config

### How It All Works

1. **Making Predictions**
   - Anyone can submit a prediction about future events
   - Each prediction includes context and probability
   - Predictions are organized by topic for easy browsing
   - The most validated predictions rise to the top

2. **Expert Validation**
   - Our AI system analyzes candidates' professional profiles across multiple platforms
   - Machine learning algorithms evaluate expertise based on:
     - Professional history and achievements
     - Publication records and citations
     - Online reputation and peer recognition
     - Industry-specific contributions
   - Only candidates who meet our high standards are approved as experts
   - Experts can validate predictions and provide detailed feedback

3. **Building Trust**
   - All validations are visible to everyone
   - The more experts validate, the more reliable the prediction
   - Experts are held to high standards of accuracy
   - Poor performance can lead to loss of expert status

4. **Reward System**
   - Experts earn points only for accurate validations
   - Points are awarded based on prediction difficulty and impact
   - Historical performance is tracked and displayed
   - Top experts gain visibility and recognition
   - Expert status can be revoked for consistently poor performance

5. **Prediction History**
   - All past predictions are archived and accessible
   - Shows actual outcomes vs. predicted probabilities
   - Experts can track their validation accuracy
   - Rewards and points are clearly displayed
   - Helps experts improve their forecasting skills
